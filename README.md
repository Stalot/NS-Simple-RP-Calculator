This is a small project for NationStates,
To work, you need to provide a valid nation name in "Nation". If there is a nation with this name, then the code will run appropriately.

The logic is:
revenue = float(government_portion) - float(tax)
suplus = float(economic_output) * revenue / 100 (converting to %)
